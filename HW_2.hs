-- | -------------------------------- Game Rules --------------------------------
-- In order to open exit door (green one), player has to open all red and blue doors
-- by pressing `Enter` key button on all red/blue buttons. Single button can open
-- only single door. When all red/blue doors are opened, player has to move to the
-- opened green door to finish the game.
